description: Create a spec file and feature branch for the next Spendly step
argument-hint: Step number and feature name e.g. 2 registration
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Glob, Bash(git:*)
---

A step number and feature name are required.
Usage: `/create-spec <step_number> <feature_name>`
Example: `/create-spec 2 registration`
If $ARGUMENTS is empty or incomplete, stop and ask for the step number and feature name.

Role: You are a senior developer spinning up a new feature for the Spendly expense tracker. Always follow the rules in CLAUDE.md.

User input: $ARGUMENTS

## Step 1 — Check working directory is clean
Run `git status` and check for uncommitted, unstaged, or untracked files. If any exist, stop immediately and tell the user to commit or stash changes before proceeding. DO NOT CONTINUE until the working directory is clean.
## Step 2 — Parse the arguments

Extract from $ARGUMENTS:
1. `step_number` — zero-padded to 2 digits: 2 → 02, 11 → 11
2. `feature_title` — human readable title in Title Case
  - Example: "Registration" or "Login and Logout"
3. `feature_slug` — git and file safe slug
   - Lowercase, kebab-case
   - Only a-z, 0-9 and -
   - Maximum 40 characters
   - Example: registration, login-logout
4. `branch_name` — format: `feature/<feature_slug>`
   - Example: `feature/registration`

If you cannot infer these from $ARGUMENTS, ask the user to clarify before proceeding.

## Step 3 — Check branch is not taken
Run `git branch` to list existing branches. If `branch_name` is already exists, append a number: `feature/registration-01`, `feature/registration-02` etc.

## Step 4 — Switch to main and pull latest

Run:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

## Step 5 — Create and switch to the feature branch
Create and switch to the feature branch

Run:

```bash
git checkout -b <branch_name>
```

## Step 6 — Research the codebase 
Read these files to understand current state:
- `CLAUDE.md`— roadmap, conventions, schema
- `app.py` — existing routes and structure
- `database/db.py` — existing schema and functions
- All files in `.claude/specs/` — avoid duplicating existing specs

Check `CLAUDE.md` to confirm the requested step is not already marked complete. If it is, warn the user and stop.


## Step 7 — Write the spec document

Write a spec to `.claude/specs/<step_number>-<feature_name>.md` following this structure:


```markdown
# Spec: <feature_title>

## Overview
[One paragraph describing what this step accomplishes and why it matters]

## Depends on
[Prior steps this feature builds on]

## Routes
Every new route needed:

- METHOD /path — description — access level (public/logged-in)

If no new routes: state "No new routes".

## Database changes
[Any new tables, columns, or constraints needed. Always verify against `database/db.py` before writing this. If none: state "No database changes".]

## Templates
[Templates to create or modify]

- Create: list new templates with their path
- Modify: list existing templates and what changes

## Files to change
[Existing files that need modification]


## Files to create
[New files to add]

## New dependencies
[Any new pip packages — If none: state "No new dependencies"]

## Rules for implementation
[Specific constraints Claude must follow] 

Always include:

- No SQLAlchemy or ORMs
- Parameterised queries only
- Passwords hashed with werkzeug
- Use CSS variables — never hardcode hex values
- All templates extend `base.html`

## Definition of done / Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [A specific testable checklist. Each item must be something that can be verified by running the app.]
```

Follow all constraints from `CLAUDE.md`:
- No ORMs — raw parameterized SQLite queries only
- Werkzeug for password hashing
- CSS variables — never hardcoded hex values
- All templates extend `base.html`
- `url_for()` for every internal link

## Step 8 — Save the spec

Save to: .claude/specs/<step_number>-<feature_slug>.md

## Step 9 — Report to the user

Print a short summary in this exact format:

Branch:    <branch_name>
Spec file: .claude/specs/<step_number>-<feature_slug>.md
Title:     <feature_title>

Then tell the user: "Review the spec at `.claude/specs/<step_number>-<feature_slug>.md` then enter Plan Mode with Shift+Tab twice to begin implementation."


Do not print the full spec in chat unless explicitly asked.
